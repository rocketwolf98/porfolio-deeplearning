# Welcome to rocketwolflab

Welcome to my corner of the internet. This is a collection of random work portfolios made out of requirement (or maybe fun). From simple experiments to complex technical deep-dives that I'm still trying to fully grasp myself.

### ‚û°Ô∏è
#### Calculating Forward Pass

Because of McCullough and Pitts and our continous desire to make our computers think, we learn how to calculate a forward pass.

### ‚ÜîÔ∏è
#### Creating a Backpropagation Pipeline

Is forward pass enough? No, because it's not learning anything, so we teach it to review.

### üìà
#### Creating a Linear Regression Model using PyTorch

We will demonstrate on how we can use PyTorch in building our own Linear Regression model using a dataset from Kaggle.

### üñºÔ∏è
#### CNN Model Training with MNIST Dataset

You may not see some news here but the computers can now see numbers. Here's how we do it and why it goes wrong.
